# Hi there, I'm Levi! 👋

### 👨‍💻 Junior Developer | Tech Enthusiast | 13 y/o | Zurich, CH

*"I build things to understand how they work. From writing my first lines of HTML to training AI models and exploring cybersecurity, I love turning code into real-world projects."*

I am currently a first-year student at Kantonsschule Limmattal. Outside of school, I spend my free time exploring different areas of tech, solving complex problems, and building software that provides real value. My long-term goal: To actively shape the tech industry.

### 🌱 My Tech Journey & Current Interests

- 🔐 **Cyber Security:** Currently my main focus. I'm learning the basics of penetration testing and having a lot of fun on *Hack The Box*.
- ⚙️ **Hardware Tinkering:** I love taking apart old electronics to reverse-engineer them and understand computing from the inside out.
- 🤖 **Python & AI:** I enjoy building scripts and participated in the CodeQuest Hackathon 2025 (2nd Place), where we built a YOLO-based fall detection model for seniors.
- 🍏 **iOS & Swift Experience:** In the past, I dove into iOS development. I learned the fundamentals of SwiftUI, REST-APIs, and JSON data, and successfully published 3 native apps (like *Bedtime Stories* and a *Pedometer*). 
- 🌐 **Web Basics:** My journey started with HTML, JavaScript and Firebase, building simple tools like an interactive digital To-Do list.
